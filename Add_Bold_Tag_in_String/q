1127. Add Bold Tag in String
中文English
Given a string s and a list of strings dict, you need to add a
closed pair of bold tag and to wrap the substrings in s that exist in dict.
If two such substrings overlap, you need to wrap them together by
only one pair of closed bold tag. Also, if two substrings wrapped by
bold tags are consecutive, you need to combine them.

Example
Input: 
s = "abcxyz123"
dict = ["abc","123"]
Output:
"<b>abc</b>xyz<b>123</b>"
Input: 
s = "aaabbcc"
dict = ["aaa","aab","bc"]
Output:
"<b>aaabbc</b>c"
Notice
The given dict won't contain duplicates, and its length won't exceed 100.
All the strings in input have length in range [1, 1000].
